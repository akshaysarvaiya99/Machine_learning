            					Machine Learning - Algorithm
            
1. Linear Regression --> y = mx+c ---> Multilinear regression,least square regression..., ----> weather forecasting,stock,sales predictions...,

2. Logistic Regression --> sigmoid/logit function --> Bi-classifaction/multi-classification ---> sentiment analysis.

3. SVM --> curve fitting & margin calculation --> Bi-classifaction ---> male/female.

4. K-means --> Ecludean distance and mean --> Clustering ---> customer grouping.

5. K-NN --> Ecludean distance --> clustering & classification ---> customer grouping/ object recognition.

6. Decision Tree --> Entropy and gini index --> regression & classification ---> anything limited to dataset.

7. Random Forest --> ensemble method --> regression & classification ---> iris flower classification.

8. AdaBoost --> ensemble method --> regression & classification ---> XGBoost,Gradient Boosting ----> iris flower classification.
 
9. LDA --> word vs sentence matrix in vector --> Topic modeling ---> LSI ----> Generating topics for paragraph.

10. TF-IDF  --> word count & number of sentence --> Topic modeling and important words identification ---> Fetching keywords from the paragraph.

11. Naives bayes --> Conditional Probability --> regression & classification ---> decision making based on some parameters.

12. Apriori --> Combination and number of occurences --> assosative identification ---> super market discount products.

13. Eclat --> Combination and number of occurences --> assosative identification ---> identification of super market discount products.

14. Hierarichy --> Ecludean distance --> clustering ---> object grouping.

                                                   Neural Network
                                                   
1. Perceptron --> weights and threshold --> decision making based on parameters.

2. Sigmoid --> weights and bias in sigmoid function --> decision making based on parameters with small changes in the input.

3. Neural Network --> based on activation function in hidden layer --> MNIST Digits classification (multiple process of same input to learn better).

4. Backpropagation --> based on error function --> weight updates from the back.

5. Gradient descent --> based on error function and learning rate ---> stochostic gradient descent ----> weight updates from the back.
